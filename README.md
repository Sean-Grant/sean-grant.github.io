## Personal Statement

Sean Grant is a Behavioral and Social Scientist at the RAND Corporation and a Professor at the Pardee RAND Graduate School. Grant is interested in advancing the overall transparency, openness, and rigor of intervention research for supporting evidence-based policy and practice. He principally researches interventions for behavioral health, though he is interested in intervention research methodology across the behavioral, social, and health sciences.

## Current Projects

I currently work on several projects that aim to develop methodological tools for social and psychological intervention research: CONSORT-SPI, a reporting guideline for randomized controlled trials of social and psychological interventions (UK ESRC; RAND PI), adapting reporting standards for protocols of social and psychological intervention trials (BITSS and LJAF; PI), and guidance for rating the quality of the body of evidence on effects of social and psychological interventions  (UK ESRC, RAND PI). 

I am also PI of a project funded by RWJF to explore the intersection of open science and Institutional Review Boards, and Co-I for a PCORI-funded project to create an online method for patient and caregiver engagement in clinical guideline development. 

Substantively, I am Co-PI of a project funded by the Wallace Foundation to review evidence on interventions that promote students' social-emotional learning outcomes, and Co-I for a NIDA-funded project to identify and evaluate decision rules for adolescent substance use treatment.
