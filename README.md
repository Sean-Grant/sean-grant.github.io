# Personal Statement

I am a behavioral and social scientist at the RAND Corporation and affiliated faculty at the Pardee RAND Graduate School. I am interested in advancing the overall transparency, openness, and rigor of intervention research for supporting evidence-based policy and practice. I principally evaluate interventions for substance use, though I am passionate about applying intervention research methods to topics spanning the behavioral, social, and health sciences.

# Current Projects

I currently work on several projects that aim to develop methodological tools for behavioral and social intervention research: CONSORT-SPI, a reporting guideline for randomized controlled trials of social and psychological interventions (UK ESRC; RAND PI), adapted reporting standards for protocols of social intervention trials (BITSS and LJAF; PI), and guidance for rating the quality of the body of evidence for complex social interventions (UK ESRC, RAND PI). 

I am also PI of a project funded by RWJF to explore if and how research transparency aligns with Institutional Review Board policies, and Co-I for a PCORI-funded project to create an online method for patient and caregiver engagement in clinical guideline development. 

Substantively, I am Co-PI of a project funded by the Wallace Foundation to review evidence on interventions that promote students' social-emotional learning outcomes, and Co-I for a NIDA-funded project to identify and evaluate decision rules for adolescent substance use treatment.
